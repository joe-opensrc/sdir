### scan dir -- sd
----
 
  Another "Hideously Functional" shell script, brought to you by Folly Projects Inc. :D

  It uses GNU 'find' and (optionally) 'du' to list files, displaying their type.
  It dereferences symlinks so you get the file type of the thing being pointed at.

  It's also quite a bit slower than 'ls' and has fewer options, but it does have colors + sorting ;)

#### USAGE 
---

      sd [-S] [-L <depth>] [-cfhsuv]

      -S          :=  do not sort output (use "found" order)
      -L <depth>  :=  limit depth of call to find + du (aka., max-*depth)
      -c          :=  /don't/ colorize output 
      -f          :=  sort filename alphabetically
      -h          :=  this help message ;) 
      -s          :=  sort by size
      -u          :=  use GNU 'du' to calculate size ( slows things down, but is informative :) )
      -v          :=  sort filename via natural-sort 
      

    > sd -s -u -c

                                           ^^^
                                            note that the directory's contents have 
                                            been taken into account when calculating its size
                                            

#### CAVEATS

    It's slow; but I wanted to use shell + awk :)
